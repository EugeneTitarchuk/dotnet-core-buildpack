This app was generated with the .NET Core CLI by running:
```
dotnet new angular -o angular_dotnet
```

From the `ClientApp` directory, `npm install --save-dev` was run. The
.gitignore file was modified so that the `ClientApp/node_modules` are included.

It is used to test the case that the Node Engine buildpack works with the .NET
Core language family to server Javascript content.
